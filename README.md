<p align="center">Hey there! I made the official MinesSMP plugin public from before the start, so you can incorporate our code into yours. However, please note the project's <a href="LICENSE">license</a>, because we would prefer you utilize our code in a good way.</p>

<p align="center">Below are the three ways <strong>YOU</strong> can use our plugin's public codebase!</p>

---

**Contributing**

This is a personal favorite. Instead of potentially ripping us off (allowed, really), you could make our playerbase happier! All you got to do is ensure your code is useful, and submit a pull request. You can also report issues in the GitHub repo! Any good contributions help, really.

**Forking**

Got good ideas, but we just won't accept them? Fork it! Your own fork is **yours**, meaning **YOU** decide what gets added. However, you still gotta follow our [license](LICENSE). Enjoy forking!

**Code inserting**

Most of our code is designed to be reusable, meaning **YOU** can copy-paste certain features! Still gotta credit us, though. We gotta give credit, don't we?
